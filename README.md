### Lorenz Attractor

This is my implementation of the Lorenz Attractor using the P5.js library. The lorenz attractor is a system of ordinary differential equations that determine the motion of a particle in 3D space. The system was studied by Edward Lorenz and he found certain parameter values that gave rise to a chaotic system. This system is visualized here.
